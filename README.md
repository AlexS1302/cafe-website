# Café Website

## Introduction
This is a simple café website built with a modular approach for clean and organised code. I used Webpack to bundle assets and improve performance, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

The focus of this project is to become familiar with Webpack and writing modular code.

## Features
* __Interactive Header__: Easy access to different pages of the website.
* __Home Page__: A welcoming landing page that introduces the café.
* __About Page__: Shares Café Bliss' mission, values and dedication to sustainability.
* __Menu Page__: Highlights the café's seasonal menu with descriptions of the available teas and desserts.


## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3 (including Flexbox & Grid)
* JavaScript
* Webpack
